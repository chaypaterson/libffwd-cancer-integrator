two-hit

Simulates first passage times in a simple two-hit model of
Moolgavkar-Vernon-Knudsen type.

We should see an initial Armitage-Doll type curve with p ~ t^2, and then after a
sojourn time

T_s ~ ln(s / mu) / s

we should see a transition region, followed by an exponential tail (source:

Integration methods
-------------------

This tests different numerical approximations to the chemical master
equation/Kolmogorov forward equation. So far I implement the Gillespie
algorithm, tau leaping (unless this was removed), and an experimental suggestion
of S. Moolgavkar's from the 1980s based on the method of characteristics.

What the simulations should be of:
----------------------------------

        /\
        |V
O ----> O ----> O

   mu0  s  mu1

Two steps, 3 populations (n0, n1, n2). n1 has an advantage/growth rate s.

Use the Gillespie algorithm for an exact sample of the master equation:

Gamma = mu0 * n0 + (mu1 + s) * n1

x = Unif(0,Gamma)

Pr mut0 = (mu0 * n0) / Gamma
Pr birth = (s * n1) / Gamma
Pr mut1 = (mu1 * n1) / Gamma

t += Exp(0, 1/Gamma)

How long does it take for an n2 to appear?

Language they should be in:
---------------------------

C/++

Plots should be automatically generated using Python/Matplotlib.
