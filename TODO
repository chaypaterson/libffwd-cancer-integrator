New implementation of Gillespie algorithm methods

Tumour suppressor loss comparison

SIMULATED ANNEALING on this comparison: show that parameters can be inferred
with ~1000x samples.
    ALMOST DONE! Sat  6 May 16:28:36 BST 2023

Can fold the all_times --> print_kaplan_meier routine from two-hit-model and
ts-loss-gillespie into its own function inside gillespie-algorithm.cpp.

IB: Graphs and plots: how close is the comparison?
    What parameter set/graph was it computed on?

    ^ Nicer plot + visualisation of TS loss graph TODO

Arb precision arithmetic? Eliminate round-off error?

Organise code! Identify important "core" stuff for libraries and separate from
tests and experiments.

Is the first passage time the appropriate point of comparison? What does this assume about prevalence that the other model doesn't?
