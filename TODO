Can fold the all_times --> print_kaplan_meier routine from two-hit-model and
ts-loss-gillespie into its own function inside gillespie-algorithm.cpp.

IB: Graphs and plots: how close is the comparison?
    What parameter set/graph was it computed on?

    ^ Nicer plot + visualisation of TS loss graph TODO
