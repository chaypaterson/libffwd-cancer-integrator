TODO:

New implementation of Gillespie algorithm methods

Tumour suppressor loss comparison

SIMULATED ANNEALING on this comparison: show that parameters can be inferred
with ~1000x samples.
    ALMOST DONE! Sat  6 May 16:28:36 BST 2023

Tue 18 Oct 11:22:53 BST 2022

Can fold the all_times --> print_kaplan_meier routine from two-hit-model and
ts-loss-gillespie into its own function inside gillespie-algorithm.cpp.

Tue 25 Oct 18:39:23 BST 2022

IB: Graphs and plots: how close is the comparison?
    What parameter set/graph was it computed on?

    ^ Nicer plot + visualisation of TS loss graph TODO


Wed 26 Oct 15:17:14 BST 2022

Arb precision arithmetic? Eliminate round-off error?

Sat  6 May 16:27:49 BST 2023

Organise code! Identify important "core" stuff for libraries and separate from
tests and experiments.

Is the first passage time the appropriate point of comparison? What does this assume about prevalence that the other model doesn't?

Mon 14 Aug 23:48:14 BST 2023

^^ most of the above has been dealt with

For the guesser program:
    Try a sinc derivative filter for the finite difference Hessian? could be
    generated programmatically.

Tue  3 Oct 15:43:22 BST 2023

^^ Most of the above done
TODO URGENT: establish how "shallow" the global vs. local minima are. This could
explain the twitchiness and sensitivity to outliers.

eigendecomposition of cov matrix!

Tue 20 Feb 16:35:24 GMT 2024
study germline mutations, see if identifiability improves

Wed 21 Feb 2024 16:04:30 GMT
current dev build of eigen requires C++>14
choose: recommend stable or change std we compile against? C++14 is probably supported

Fri 23 Feb 18:00:37 GMT 2024
TODO: DECIDE ON C++ STANDARD! NAIL THIS DOWN
and decide on what fitness to put in the new simulations for the
germline/sporadic study

discuss both with colleagues

Still studying identifiability, trying to speed up inference by using
parallelisation. Could parallelise generate_data by running replicates on new
cores?

Can I identify a symmetry that would make the model structurally unidentifiable?

should make a method for accessing the parameter vector as it is a common idiom.

bind the likelihood to a function evaluation and just try to make a heatmap in
the python notebook???? use Josh's notes

the whole point is it's cheap to evaluate now
