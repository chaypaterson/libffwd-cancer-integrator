New implementation of Gillespie algorithm methods

Tumour suppressor loss comparison

SIMULATED ANNEALING on this comparison: show that parameters can be inferred
with ~1000x samples.
    ALMOST DONE! Sat  6 May 16:28:36 BST 2023

Tue 18 Oct 11:22:53 BST 2022

Can fold the all_times --> print_kaplan_meier routine from two-hit-model and
ts-loss-gillespie into its own function inside gillespie-algorithm.cpp.

Tue 25 Oct 18:39:23 BST 2022

IB: Graphs and plots: how close is the comparison?
    What parameter set/graph was it computed on?

    ^ Nicer plot + visualisation of TS loss graph TODO


Wed 26 Oct 15:17:14 BST 2022

Arb precision arithmetic? Eliminate round-off error?

Sat  6 May 16:27:49 BST 2023

Organise code! Identify important "core" stuff for libraries and separate from
tests and experiments.

Is the first passage time the appropriate point of comparison? What does this assume about prevalence that the other model doesn't?

Mon 14 Aug 23:48:14 BST 2023

^^ most of the above has been dealt with

For the guesser program:
    Try a sinc derivative filter for the finite difference Hessian? could be
    generated programmatically.

Tue  3 Oct 15:43:22 BST 2023

^^ Most of the above done
TODO URGENT: establish how "shallow" the global vs. local minima are. This could
explain the twitchiness and sensitivity to outliers.

study germline mutations, see if identifiability improves

Wed 21 Feb 2024 16:04:30 GMT
current dev build of eigen requires C++>14
choose: recommend stable or change std we compile against? C++14 is probably supported

TODO: DECIDE ON C++ STANDARD! NAIL THIS DOWN
and decide on what fitness to put in the new simulations for the
germline/sporadic study

discuss both with colleagues

Still studying identifiability, trying to speed up inference by using
parallelisation. Could parallelise generate_data by running replicates on new
cores?

Can I identify a symmetry that would make the model structurally unidentifiable?

Thu 28 Mar 19:19:47 GMT 2024
should make a method for accessing the parameter vector as it is a common idiom.

bind the likelihood to a function evaluation and just try to make a heatmap in
the python notebook???? use Josh's notes

the whole point is it's cheap to evaluate now

TODO: yes to heatmap
reruns with s2 pinned?

Tue  2 Jul 2024 11:11:44 KST

Late deviations in S-curves: examine Kaplan-Meier plots but check for polyclonality? i.e. look for a SECOND passage time with a different type.

Wed 28 Aug 17:15:17 BST 2024

Just finish the visualisations for the manuscript, stop trying to add and fix
new shit.

Next: sample likelihood function in 3d and print a voxel cube file. The format:
Voxel\n
resolution, rows
resolution, cols
resolution, layers
rows * cols * layers * 3 (colour channels) * sizeof(float)
(until end of file)

Currently takes ~5min to sample a 16x16x16 cube, single threaded on atuin. May
as well parallelise the sampling and run some batches on the CSF if the initial
results are intriguing.

Corrected discrete hazard (Ge)

Germline again?
