Late anomalies in cancer incidence

A class of exact solutions to chemical master equations with applications to
colorectal cancer incidence

Problem: Moolgavkar-Lubeck model fails at very late ages. observed incidence
is unusually low. this is often given a biological explanation in terms of
either the dynamics of old age or genetic susceptibility. Only a fraction of
the population are susceptible or will die of this cancer.

I will call this deviation in observed incidence a "late incidence anomaly".
Qualitatively, we can describe it as a sustained deviation below Moolgavkar
and Lubeck's $t^k e^{a t}$ curve. It is either a plateau or an exponential
relaxation.

I doubt the biological explanation because our simulations from 2019, with no
cell death at all, also shows a late incidence anomaly. What I think is
happening instead is this:

* The full system of master equations for a birth-migration process on a graph
  is linear. It has some lowest eigenvalues 0 and \lambda.
* Eventually, the probability P that the end state is visited will go as
      P ~ A e^{-\lambda t}
* Lubeck points out (in that PNAS review I think) that in cases with no
  growth, a reversion to exponential approach from Armitage-Doll-type log-log
  behaviour occurs after a timescale of
    \mu t ~ 1
  or about a million years. This almost certainly never happens.
* But in cases where there is exponential growth, I think the relevant
* timescale may instead be
    \mu (e^{a t} - 1)/a ~ 1
    or t ~ (1/a) ln(1+a/\mu)
  This is much shorter, on the order of a few decades.

What needs to be done is to find an exact solution to the n-step
birth-migration process and check the relevant timescale.

Progress towards exact solution:

3 coupled birth-death processes:

0 --> 1 --> 2

1 has a fitness advantage s
mutation rates are \mu (0 --> 1) and r (1 --> 2)

Fitness advantage on 2 is arbitrary (does not affect the probability P(n_2 =
0)). So the only parameters are \mu, r, s, and initial pop N0.

The overall method:

Can transform master equation into a transport equation (following Gans).
Then, can use method of characteristics to find a general solution. This can
be expressed as a series of integrals -- so we can give an "exact" solution as
long as these integrals are analytically tractable.

I think they are right on the edge of tractability but it might be possible
using beta functions.

 Birth: -

The two-hit model is exactly solvable: an analytical solution for the generating
function can be written out in terms of hypergeometric functions.

The transition from an early Armitage-Doll type stage (I am still checking if
the Lubeck-Moolgavkar regime exists, I think it should) to a later stage
characterised by exponential approach happens MUCH earlier than \mu t ~ 1. I can
prove rigorously for this model that it when

t > ln((r + s)/(A s)) /s, the difference < r / s << 1

for A = 1 + \sqrt 3.

To do now:
    Establish when the mixed power-law exponential regime (Lubeck-Moolgavkar)
    holds.

    It is worth checking if the version with death (and not just birth) is also
    solvable. I expect yes.

    Try to solve the 3-step model by a similar process.

How could this have been missed? It is huge.
    Chemical master equations are very difficult to solve -- a state space for a
    3 hit model with populations less than <100 already involves 100^4 = 10^8
    states. This is a large amount of memory for the numerical solution.
    A cutoff needs to be introduced for numerical solutions. When one of the
    populations is exponentially growing this becomes inaccurate very quickly.
    (Cite: Jahnke 2006)

    Checking with a computer that mu t << 1 is necessary will run up against the
    cutoffs, and will never hit the extremely large populations that result in
    the crossover.

    Only very simple (0-step queueing processes, Palm / P Todorovic 1992) were
    expected to be solvable. Coupled processes with 2 or more steps have not
    been studied as extensively as the case with no immigration.

    Exact solutions have become less important since the invention of the
    Gillespie algorithm allows for efficient simulations that don't require
    cutoffs.

Implications:
    Fits for cancer incidence are likely correct, but should probably be
    re-interpreted. Plateaus and inflection points may indicate a transition to
    mutation-limited behaviour from selection-limited rather than novel biology
    or observational bias.

    If moment-closure and mean-field approaches fail so early -- much earlier
    than previously believed -- for very simple reactions, perhaps they should
    not be trusted for more complex reactions. Cite the DSB/conditioned means
    papers and the Gillespie paper where he does something similar.

Compare to Vastola

Add migration. Important. See emails with Georg.

It beats Jahnke because this system is autocatalytic.

Also, when the difference between roots is an integer, Frobenius' method
requires a 

    log(z)

term. This is important!

In our case, we want the characteristics to have no terms that grow indefinitely
as t --> -\infty, and log(z) ~ \lambda t, so the logarithmic term should be
zero.

It needs to be mentioned that this term normally exists and HAPPENS to be zero
in our case, though.

Also: note that \gamma is NOT an integer in general.

Revisit CRC paper and try to improve on Moolgavkar's 1979 idea of numerically
integrating characteristics

I believe a viable numerical algorithm is now complete based on the literature
Georg recommended. Multi-path models should now be soluble, this is a
generalisation.

Basic idea: integrate system backwards using method of characteristics (MOC).

Why is this useful?
    Most existing stochastic simulation methods are either slow and exact with
    limited precision for the probabilities, or fast and inaccurate with high
    precision, or somewhere in between. This makes it difficult to study rare
    events at high accuracy using existing methods. (Compare Gillespie and mean
    field, using Winkelmann and Schutte).

    A fast, accurate, and highly precise method of determining hazard functions
    was developed by Georg Luebeck and Suresh Moolgavkar, by reducing the
    computation of the probability to a quadrature. Here, we generalise the
    overall approach to arbitrary graphs and steps.

Also has applications to polyclonality which is difficult to model.

Not generalise: this is a left-field alternative to Georg and Suresh's approach.
It is more closely related to Quinn's algorithm (which did not see wide use).
