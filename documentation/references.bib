                            provides an accurate description of stochastic
                            biochemical reaction networks in well-mixed
                            conditions, but it cannot be solved analytically for
                            most systems of practical interest. While Monte
                            Carlo methods provide a principled means to probe
                            the system dynamics, their high computational cost
                            can render the estimation of molecule number
                            distributions and other numerical tasks infeasible
                            due to the large number of repeated simulations
                            typically required. In this paper we aim to leverage
                            the representational power of neural networks to
                            approximate the solutions of the CME and propose a
                            framework for Neural Estimation of Stochastic
                            Simulations for Inference and Exploration (Nessie).
                            Our approach is based on training a neural network
                            to learn the distributions predicted by the CME from
                            a relatively small number of stochastic simulations,
                            thereby accelerating computationally intensive tasks
                            such as parameter exploration and inference. We show
                            on biologically relevant examples that simple neural
                            networks with one hidden layer are able to capture
                            highly complex distributions across parameter space.
                            We provide a detailed discussion of the neural
                            network implementation and code for easy

	abstract = {A vestibular schwannoma (VS) is a relatively rare, benign tumour of the eighth cranial nerve, often involving alterations to the gene NF2. Previous mathematical models of schwannoma incidence have not attempted to account for alterations in specific genes, and could not distinguish between point mutations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Here, we present a mechanistic approach to modelling initiation and malignant transformation in Schwannoma. Each parameter is associated with a specific gene or mechanism operative in Schwann cells, and can be determined by combining incidence data with empirical frequencies of pathogenic variants and LOH. This results in new estimates for the base pair mutation rate u = 4.48 {\texttimes} 10-10 and the rate of LOH = 2.03 {\texttimes} 10-6/yr in Schwann cells. In addition to new parameter estimates, we extend the approach to estimate the risk of both spontaneous and radiation-induced malignant transformation. We conclude that radiotherapy is likely to have a negligible excess risk of malignancy for sporadic VS, with a possible exception of rapidly growing tumours.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
